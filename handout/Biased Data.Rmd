Our goal is  to make some progress in understanding the 
expression "algorithmic bias", focusing on biases on 
the input side, namely the historical data 
on which predictive algorithms are trained. 

Let's start with some
observations about different forms of bias. 
Like "being" in Aristotle's *Metaphysics*, 
bias is said in many ways. Two well-known forms of 
bias are cognitive bias and social bias. 

 
 
 
# **Cognitive and social bias**


A *cognitive bias* is a deviation from the standards of rationality. Examples of 
cognitive biases are logical fallacies, confirmation bias, availability heuristics, framing effects.^[See, for example,  Kahneman et al (eds) (1982), Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases, Cambridge UP and more recently Gilovich et al (eds) (2002), Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgement, Cambridge UP.]

A *social bias* is a deviation from the 
(moral?) norm of treating everybody equally (or treating everybody with the concern and respect 
they deserve given the circumstances). It is an individual or group attitude, 
consciously accessible or not, that results in beliefs or actions 
that are discriminatory against members of certain social groups. 

`r tufte::margin_note("This is a working defintion which could be too general and thus unhelpful.")` So, in its most general sense, we could define bias as any *deviation from an accepted 
standard or norm*.

# **Information bias and stereotype bias**

Our goal here is to understand algorithmic bias (more 
on this soon). Perhaps, defining bias 
as deviation from a norm or standard is 
not the right definition for 
describing algorithmic bias. 
Here are two other forms of bias.
First, bias as prior information:

> In AI and machine learning, *bias* refers to prior information ... Yet bias can be problematic when prior information is derived from precedents known to be harmful ... we will call harmful biases 'prejudice'....prejudice is a special case of bias identifiable only by its negative consequences (p. 2/14)^[Caliskan et al (2017), Semantics Derived Automatically from Language Corpora Contain Human-like Biases]

Second, bias as a reasoning, decision or action 
pattern that instantiates 
social-kind inductions:

> ... bias ... [consists] .... 
of mental entities that take propositional mental states as inputs and return propositional mental
states as outputs in a way that instantiates social-kind inductions....
>
> (i) Jan is elderly.
(ii) Elderly people are bad with computers.
(iii) Jan is bad with computers. ^[Johnson (2020), The Structure of Bias, Mind, 129(516): 1193â€“1236. This definition is also connected to the notion of stereotypes or group generalizations.]

These two quotations introduce 
other forms of bias, which we could call 
*information bias* and *stereotype bias*. 
These forms of bias may intersect with 
cognitive and social bias. For example, stereotype 
bias might be what social bias ultimately consists in.


# **Algorithmic bias**

When we speak of algorithmic bias, we are not using the word "bias" 
as in "cognitive bias" or "social bias". `r tufte::margin_note("Is algorithmic bias a form or byproduct of information or stereotype bias?")` Algorithms follow the instructions 
given to them and apply them uniformly. Arguably, they cannot be cognitively 
or socially biased. Or can they?

Algorithms can be biased if they inherit---and then reproduce and even amplify---biases embedded in the historical data used to train them or biases embedded in society and reflected in the data.`r tufte::margin_note("What do these expressions mean? What standards would data deviate from?")` We often talk about biased data, for example, racially biased, gender biased or age biased data.

# Examples

Let's consider a few examples`r tufte::margin_note("For each example, 
identify the norm from which the deviation occurs and the kind 
of data or society bias at issue.")` of claims that have been made about biases in society, data or 
algorithms: 

a. Disparities in the severity of charges against black defendants 
compared to white defendants after controlling for several factors.^[See Starr and Rehavi (2014), 
[Racial Disparity in Federal Criminal Sentences, J of Pol Ec](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/677255?mobileUi=0&), 122(6):1320-1354.] 

b. A SAT question that asks students to complete the verbal analogy
*Runner:Marathon=x:Regatta*. 
The solution is *x=oarsman*. `r tufte::margin_note("Think of the SAT exam as an algorithm to score academic preparation.")`
The question is biased against students unfamiliar with regattas, because of country of origin, language spoken at home, socioeconomic status.

c. The analogy 
`r tufte::margin_note("Possible solution: distinguish between gendered words (such as queen and king) and non-gendered words (such as programmer and homemaker). 
See Kearns and Roth (2020), The Ethical Algorithm, p. 63. Is this a good solution?")` 
*Man:Programmer=Woman: Homemaker* completed by Google algorithm 
word2vec. It reproduces gender stereotypes.

d. Amazon algorithm for screening job applicants. It penalized applicants for engineering positions whose resumes contain the word "woman".  

e. COMPAS algorithm for guiding decisions about bail, preventative detention or sentencing. 
Its false positive classification error rate for black people is twice as high as 
that for white people.^[ProPublica (2016), [Machine Bias: There's Software Used Across the Country to Predict Future Criminals. And it's Biased Against Blacks.](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing)] 

f. For the same risk score assigned by a health algorithm, black patients are sicker than white patients. Risk scores are based on health costs per patient as a proxy for level of sickness.^[Obermeyer et al (2019), [Dissecting Racial Bias in an Algorithm Used to Manage the Health of Populations](https://www.science.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aax2342), Science, 366(6464): 447-453.]

# **Some distinctions**

## data // algorithm

`r tufte::margin_note("Consider a perfectly accurate classification algorithm. Could this 
algorithm still be regarded as biased?")`
Under what circumstances is the algorithm biased and under what 
circumstances are the data biased? Or is this distinction misleading?

## supervised // unsupervised learning


`r tufte::margin_note("Does the notion of bias differs in the context of 
supervised and supervised learning?
")` Machine learning algorithms can be distinguished between 
supervised learning algorithms (e.g. regression, SVM, random forest, Bayes 
classifier) and unsupervised ones (e.g. clustering such as Google algorithm word2vec). 


## related words

We use the word bias along with: 
disparity; discrimination; prejudice; stereotype; 
injustice; unfairness; etc. `r tufte::margin_note("What else?
")` Obviously, we should 
not confuse them, even though there seems 
to be points of overlap.


# **Biased data**

Let's focus on the data on which algorithms are trained. Data can be biased for several difference reasons. 
In the most general sense, data are biased if they 
unequally portray different socially relevant groups (say racial or gender groups). 
This definition is general 
(which is a good thing), but also over-inclusive
(which is a bad thing). 

Here are some examples:  
`r tufte::margin_note("Which are instances of bias 
in the data and why?")`

- The outcome of interest is represented by 
a proxy in the historical data. This proxy tracks the actual outcome unevenly depending 
on the social group (see, for example, item f. above)

- Data reflect biases in society (see, for example, items c. and d.) 
`r tufte::margin_note("What are other examples of biases in society reflected in the data? 
Are biases in society different from social bias as defined earlier?")`

- Uneven representation in the training data of people belonging to 
different racial, gender or other socially relevant groups.^[For an example about the medical data, see Perez (2019), Invisible Women, p. 167.]

-   Data for different social groups might have 
different sample sizes, which leads to differences in the variability 
of the parameters estimates. The sample size for minority groups 
tends to be smaller than the sample size 
for majority groups.

> Our models about minorities generally tend to be worse than 
those about the general population ... this is assuming the classifier learned 
on the general population does not transfer to the minority faithfully.^[Hardt (2014), How Big Data is Unfair. For example, compare confidence intervals for the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine for white people 
and minorities. See Polack et al (2020), [Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577), N Engl J Med, 383:2603-2615.]



- The correlations between attributes (predictors) and the 
outcome of interest is not uniform across groups. The same set of predictors 
could perform differently for different social groups thus requiring group-specific 
predictive models. Here is an example:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.margin = FALSE, fig.fullwidth = TRUE, fig.cap="Fitting a Support Vector Machine (SVM) liner model to the ProPublica COMPAS data.", out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/mdibello/My Drive/Teaching/algorithmicfairness/SVM-PropublicaData_files/figure-html/plot SVM models by race-1.png") 
```


# **Risks in predictive algorithm**

Predictive algorithms output a risk score, an assessment of how probable it is that an individual would, say, commit a crime or default on a loan.  What is the meaning of this risk? Does it make sense to assign risk to an individual?


>  ... current risk assessment instruments are unable to distinguish one person's risk of violence
from another's ... a predictive algorithm might confidently estimate a person's risk of arrest
as somewhere between a range of five and fifteen percent. Studies have demonstrated that predictive
models can only make reliable predictions about a person's risk of violence within very large ranges
of likelihood, such as twenty to sixty percent. As a result, virtually everyone's range of likelihood
overlaps. When everyone is similar, it becomes impossible to differentiate people with low and high
risks of violence.^[Barabas et al, [Technical Flaws of Pretrial Risk Assessments Raise Grave Concerns](https://cyber.harvard.edu/story/2019-07/technical-flaws-pretrial-risk-assessments-raise-grave-concerns). See Hart and Cooke (2013), [Another Look at the (Im-)precision of Individual Risk Estimates Made Using Actuarial Risk Assessment Instruments](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23322617/), Behavioral Science and Law, 31(1):81-102.]
