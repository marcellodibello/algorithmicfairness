    Based on college admission data. Paper argues against excluding race as a predictor for the purpose of achieving better algorithmic fairness.) 
    
## Fairness through awareness

## Individual Fairness

 > (Fairness as the principle that any two individuals who are similar with respect to a particular task should be classified similarly. Uses a distance metric that defines the similarity between the individuals. Any two individuals x, y that are at distance d(x, y) map to distributions M(x) and M(y), respectively, such that the statistical distance between M(x) and M(y) is at most d(x, y). The distributions over outcomes observed by x and y are indistinguishable up to their distance d(x, y).)

## Classification parity (equal FP and FN)

## Predictive parity
